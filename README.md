<h3>What is it </h3>
<p>The Energy Performance Chain is a blockchain application that considers the energy spending, green energy usage and energy sharing of companies, comparing them to other companies of similar industries, sizes and locations. We periodically mint an NFT for every company listed, which displays their ranking in green energy usage, energy spending and energy sharing compared to their competitors. </p>
